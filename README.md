# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project aims to detect driver drowsiness based on eye, mouth, and head position. The model uses facial landmark points to determine if the driver is yawning, drowsy, or has a tilted head, and provides an alert accordingly.

## Features
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: Used to detect drowsiness by monitoring eye closure.
- **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)**: Used to detect yawning.
- **Head Tilt Detection**: Measures the angle of head tilt to detect potential drowsiness or fatigue.
